# Industrial Copper Modeling

This project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting the selling price of copper and classifying leads in the manufacturing domain. The project utilizes Python scripting, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), Streamlit for creating a web application, and various machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement

The copper industry deals with data related to sales and pricing, which may suffer from skewness and noisy data. Manual predictions are time-consuming and may not yield optimal pricing decisions. The goal is to build a regression model for predicting the selling price and a classification model for lead classification (WON or LOST).

## Approach

1. Data Understanding: Identify variable types and distributions. Clean the data by removing rubbish values and treating reference columns as categorical variables.

2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, treat outliers using IQR or Isolation Forest, address skewness in continuous variables, and encode categorical variables.

3. EDA: Visualize outliers and skewness before and after treatment using Seaborn plots.

4. Feature Engineering: Create new features if applicable and drop highly correlated columns using a heatmap.

5. Model Building and Evaluation: Split the dataset, train and evaluate regression and classification models using suitable evaluation metrics. Optimize hyperparameters using cross-validation and grid search.

6. Model GUI: Use Streamlit to create an interactive web application. Perform feature engineering, scaling, and transformations, and display predictions based on the trained models.
